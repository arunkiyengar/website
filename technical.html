        <h2>Caching and Dynamic Content Generation for the Web</h2>
        <p class="work">One of my key technical contributions has been inventing and implementing new techniques for consistently caching dynamic data to improve Web performance. Dynamic Web content can consume orders of magnitude more CPU time to serve than static content. 
          Generating dynamic content is often the performance bottleneck for Web sites, even if only a fraction of the content is 
          generated dynamically. The difficult challenge is to serve dynamic content efficiently while providing current and consistent 
          information.
        </p>
        <p class="work">The following USITS '97 paper describes techniques we developed for caching dynamic data to improve 
          performance at highly accessed real Web sites:
          <cite><a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/usits97/full_papers/iyengar/iyengar.pdf">"Improving Web Server Performance 
            by Caching Dynamic Data"</a> (with Jim Challenger). In Proceedings of the USENIX 1997 Symposium on Internet Technologies 
            and Systems (USITS '97), Monterey, CA, December 1997.</cite>
        </p>
        <p class="work">
          A key component of this work is a cache which can efficiently store data from Web and other distributed applications 
          via an API invoked by applications, a new concept at the time. The following technical report provides more details of our cache and its API. 
          Since that time, caches of this type (such as memcached, Redis, PHP caches, Python caches, ASP.NET caches, IBM WebSphere DynaCache 
          and eXtreme Scale) have become widely used for improving performance at Web sites as well as in other distributed applications.<br />

          The following papers introduce cache dependencies for maintaining consistency between cached dynamic objects and underlying data which affect their values; the INFOCOM '99 paper describes how 
          they were successfully deployed at a major Web site to significantly improve performance and consistency levels for dynamic data. Since that time, cache dependencies have become commonly used by many 
          developers and are a key feature of tools for building Web sites such as Microsoft's ASP.NET, PHP frameworks such as Yii, and Python.<br />

          The following paper describes our pioneering use of fragment-based techniques for generating dynamic Web content for highly accessed real Web sites. These techniques allow fragment caching. Since that time, fragment-based Web publication has become widely used and is a key feature of commonly used Web content management systems such as WordPress. Support for fragment caching after our work became extensive. 
          Several PHP frameworks, Microsoft's ASP.NET, Python, 
          and Ruby on Rails support fragment caching as do Oracle, Akamai, and others.

        <h2>Load Balancing and Scheduling</h2>
        <p class="work">
          I co-invented <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6424992B2/en">Web load balancing with affinity between specific clients 
            and servers (sticky load balancing).</a>
        </p>
        <p class="work">This work was incorporated into IBM's Network Dispatcher load balancer. Since that time, load balancing with 
          affinity has become widely used and is now a standard feature of just about all commonly used Web load balancers 
          (such as the Apache HTTP Server load balancer and Nginx). Among other things, this is important for supporting high TLS (SSL) request rates for secure (encrypted) communications over the Web such as when credit card transactions are made. Load balancing with affinity is also important for other protocols such as the Session Initiation 
          Protocol (SIP) as described in our INFOCOM 2009 and 2012 IEEE/ACM Transctions on Networking papers.

        <p class="work">I am interested in both main memory and persistent storage allocation. A major theme of my work in this area has been allocators which adapt themselves to request size distributions to optimize performance and minimize fragmentation. The first paper describes a disk storage allocation system which outperforms both file systems and databases for the workloads we used. This disk storage allocation system has been successful in several real deployments. The second paper presents main 
          memory allocation algorithms which are particularly well suited for parallel computer systems.

        <h2>Capacity Planning, Performance Modelling and Monitoring</h2>
        <p class="work">
          I am interested in capacity planning, performance modelling, and monitoring for both scientific and commercial workloads. I have developed improved techniques for predicting customer workloads in the future from past behavior. This allows customers to estimate how much capacity will be required in the future. It also helps schedule tasks to optimize utilization of system resources and efficiently make use of spare CPU cycles in grid environments. Several of the techniques described in the papers in this section have been successfully used commercially.
