        <p class="description"><span class="first-letter">A</span>run Iyengar has extensive experience as a software engineer, computer scientist, 
          and consultant. His areas of expertise include data management and analytics, cloud computing, 
          artificial intelligence, distributed and parallel computing, fault tolerance and high availability, and financial computing. Arun has worked for Cisco Research, IBM&#39;s T.J Watson Research Center and Hewlett-Packard and consulted for several other companies.

        <p class="description">
          Arun's work has been incorporated into products and services by many companies as well as commonly 
          used open source software. His caching and load balancing techniques are widely used to improve performance 
          for Web sites and distributed applications. He has recently developed techniques for caching responses from large language models (LLMs) which significantly reduce response times and costs. He has also developed widely used techniques for dynamically 
          generating Web content which have been incorporated into Web content management systems as well as a widely used method for preserving state on the Web without using cookies.
        </p>
        <p class="description">He has written software for improving the performance, functionality, and usability of cloud services. 
          Arun's techniques for dynamic memory allocation and pricing are widely used in serverless (cloud) computing. 
          He has also developed machine learning software for real data prediction problems faced by customers.
        </p>
	<p class="description">
	  Arun's recent work includes algorithms and software for investing in financial securities including stocks, bonds, commodities, and stock market volatility futures.
         His investment approach takes into account different types of securities and changing financial and macroeconomic conditions to make optimal investment choices based on the
         investorâ€™s risk tolerance level.
